This JDM Blogging Page should contain:

* Responsive layout using HTML/CSS and implemented design principles from the previous lessons
* A database that contains all relevant data (e.g. user data, articles, page content, etc.).
* Two seperate Layouts for unregistred as well as registred users
* A login form that registered users can use to log in. Once a user is logged in, they should be able to edit data in the database.
* A registration form that unregistered users can use to log in. This form should require at least four fields to be filled in and validated correctly (e.g. username, password,
E- mail address, last name, first name, etc.).

## JDM-Blog (Explenation) ðŸ’¬
***

The main purpose of the JDM blog is to network with other people who share the same hobby as me: They also own a car imported from Japan, maintain it, take it out for a drive and show their car at meetings. The blog scheme is meant to serve as a diary, a snapshot of past and future car meets. The site is intended to highlight upcoming car meets, capture past car meets for eternity via the blog feature, and list users who may present themselves in a summary table.
